# hello-world
I enjoyed this week's lab session. 
I was able to learn about the different avenues the biotechnology field offers.
I really enjoyed Professor Rahman's enthusiam when it came to our success. Its nice to have professors who believe in you.
PS it took me 3x to do this assignement and on my last try, I realized I didnt follow the prompt lol
